# EasyBank
Fictional bank landing page.


### Project challenges

I began this project with nothing more than an image of the design. I took this project on as an opprotunity to practice the fundementals of web development. I wanted to code everything from scratch in order to create a strong foundation on which to continue learning.

### My process

Any good work starts with the preparation. I began work by studying the design image I was provided, taking notes on how I would nest my html elements in order to later make responsive. Once I felt ready
I got to work developing the sections from top to bottom starting with the navigation and making my way down.
